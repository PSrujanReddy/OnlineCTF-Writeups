# Challenge 4: TRY HACK ME
Question:TryHackMe is a browser-based cyber security training platform,
with learning content covering all skill levels from the complete beginner
to the seasoned hacker.
One of our team member is very active on the platform. Recently, I got to know
that he comes under 3% in the global leaderboard. Impressive isn't it.
Maybe you should have a look at his profile

PS : He keeps his digital identity very simple. No fancy usernames. It's just a simple mathematics

Hints:
His real name == His username

The question mentions that one of the staff of VishwaCTF is top 3% globally on TryHackMe.
So I went ahead and checked the staff and authors of VishwaCTF on their main website.
