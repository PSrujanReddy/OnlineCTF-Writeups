# Hardware Heist

* **Event:** VishwaCTF
* **Problem Type:** Misc
* **Point Value / Difficulty:** Easy
* **(Optional) Tools Required / Used:** [dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/ascii-code)

## Description
Your cyber gang has stolen a hardware device code from the CIA but are unable to use it. Although while stealing the code, you have found some binary strings which might be helpful to understand the device. You might even find the important codes after solving the device and strings.

## Solution

After downloading the attachments and reviewing the content of the binary text file, I opted to utilize the previously mentioned online binary to ASCII tool. Fortunately, I successfully obtained the flag directly without having to resort to the other file.

Flag:- `VishwaCTF{h4ck325_5uck_47_h42dw423}`
