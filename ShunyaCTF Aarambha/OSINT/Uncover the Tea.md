# Challenge 1: Uncover the Tea

Question: Yo, so imagine this crazy drama dive, fam! You got two major rap stars going at it like it's nobody's business, 
taking their beef from tweets to real-life blows at some fancy event. One even came out with a massive bump on her forehead,
yeah, that's your clue, no cap fr dude, like, it was straight-up insane! And then, there's this record label, right? 
Rumor has it they were trading avocado toast recipes or arguing over who's got the better Spotify playlist. They're in deep 
trouble, with lawsuits flying left and right, shady deals going down, it's like watching a Netflix thriller unfold, fr. But 
wait, there's more! There's this whole motorsport incident that went down, with rumors flying about who was involved and what 
actually went down, man. It's like a whole conspiracy theory brewing, with twists and turns hotter than the tea we spill, you 
feel me? And speaking of brainstorming, I heard they were sipping on some green, but not the organic kind you find at Whole 
Foods. Nah, bruh, we're talking that Netflix series-level drama, with more plot twists than a Kanye West tweet. So grab your 
popcorn and get ready for the tea, 'cause this story's about to get wilder than my DMs after a breakup!

So I searched in google for articles related to "Rappers fights and headbumps",
Then I came across this article that piqued my interest,
[Article Link](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/09/08/cardi-b-and-nicki-minaj-fight-new-york-fashion-week-party/1237978002/)

The article talks about Cardi B getting injured after fight with Nicki Minaj at New York Fashion Week party, after further looking into the 
article I found out the reason they fought was beacuse, In a post on Instagram, Cardi B didn't call out Minaj by name 
but alluded to the fight and said she was sparked because her mothering skills were being disparaged.

I Think Cardi has BEEN Wanting To Put Hands On Nicki, So She Just Justified Her Actions By Using 'She Spoke On My Child
' As An Excuse. Theirs No Receipts Of Nicki Ever Speaking On Her Kid.

And there also other things like the record label,trading avocado toast recipes or arguing over who's got the better Spotify playlist.

All these made me come to conclusion that this is about them.

So the event is 2018 New York Fashion Week .

First person is the one who got hit is Cardi B and the other one is Nicki Minaj.
