# Challenge 3: Sagar Sangram
Question:Once upon a time there were 2 groups, one was known for being on positive side and other on negative side.
Both the groups wanted to be immortal and hence required a divine potion for it. So they decided to "Churn the Ocean"
to get the divine potion.

It's a wonderful event written in some of the ancient scriptures.
